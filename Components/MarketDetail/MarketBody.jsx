                  The MACD index is indicating that momentum is shifting from
                  bullish to bearish following a negative crossover. When the
                  MACD falls below the signal line, it is typically considered
                  to be a bearish development favoring short positions. On the
                  other hand, note that the Relative Strength Index has gone
                  below 30, going into oversold conditions and allowing more
                  gains. Euro-Dollar's lower Bollinger BandÂ® is at 1.0476,
                  indicating that the asset has overextended to the downside and
                  could, therefore, bounce back as buyers look for bargains.

                  Overall, looking at the technical analysis landscape, it seems
                  that although indicators are mixed and some are pointing in
                  different directions further drawbacks may be next for the
                  Euro.
